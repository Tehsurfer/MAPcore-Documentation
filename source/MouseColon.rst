Overview
********
Structural data of mouse and pig colons from the Howard and Tache groups and a 3D scaffold fitted to these data is visualized in the webGL window.  This use-case demonstrates the ability to customise the 3D scaffold to specific species and subject. Enteric neurons and nerve fibers imaged from mouse tissue samples (Tache) and displayed at labelled material points on the scaffold are also able to be visualized. Vasculature imaging from mouse data (Howard) are visualized at annotated points on the colon scaffold. This use-case also demonstrates the ability to annotate points on a scaffold and save both the scaffold parameters and the annotations back into PMR.
