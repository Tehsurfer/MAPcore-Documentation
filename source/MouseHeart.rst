Overview
********
   
Mouse heart immunohistochemical mapping of neural pathways in cleared heart (sham heart 4) stained with PGP9.5
(glycoprotein surface axonal antibody labelling) from the Shivkumar/Pradeep group is displayed in a 3D mouse heart
scaffold that has been fitted to the segmented heart surface data from Sham Heart 44, which provides a more extensive
geometric dataset. Future experiments are likely to provide much better quality mouse data for both the heart's anatomy
and its embedded neurons. Figure 1 illustrates an overview of the workflow.
