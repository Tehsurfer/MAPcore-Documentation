Overview
********
   
Mouse heart immunohistochemical mapping of neural pathways in cleared heart (sham heart 4) stained with PGP9.5
(glycoprotein surface axonal antibody labelling) from the Shivkumar/Pradeep group is displayed in a 3D mouse heart
scaffold that has been fitted to the segmented heart surface data from Sham Heart 44, which provides a more extensive
geometric dataset. Future experiments are likely to provide much better quality mouse data for both the heart's anatomy
and its embedded neurons. Figure 1 illustrates an overview of the workflow.

      Highlight features/capabilities that are particular to this use-case.
	   
:ref:`Flatmap-Viewer`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The :ref:`Flatmap-Viewer` represents a high-level view of overall connectivity of the autonomic nervous system.
	
:ref:`Scaffold-Viewer`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
:ref:`Scaffold-Viewer` is used to view the anatomical organ scaffold of the specific organ selected on the Flatmap.
	
:ref:`Data-Viewer`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This viewer is used to view the *Electrocardiograph* data recorded with the experiment video. Refer the section :ref:`Data-Viewer`.
